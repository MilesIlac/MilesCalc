# TestCalc
Calculator app made in Java

## General Info
Calculator logic made into an android app. Instead of importing a dependency, I coded the logic from scratch to test my problem-solving skills. 

## Features
* 0-9 number buttons, a period button for decimal values, (+,-,x,/) buttons and even a % button for modulo operation
* Follows the order of operations
* A small textview to show your equation, and a big textview to show the calculated answer
* A clear button (denoted by C) to delete numbers in the equation area and a quit button to close the calculator
* Dark blue design
